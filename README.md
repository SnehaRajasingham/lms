# Library Management System (LMS)

This is a full-stack **Library Management System** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and a **React + TypeScript** frontend. It allows administrators to manage books and users, and students to borrow and return books. The system includes **authentication**, **role-based access control**, **fine calculation**, and comprehensive **software testing** using **Vitest**, **Jest**, and **Postman**.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

This project was developed as part of a **Software Quality Management** coursework, with a strong emphasis on testing strategies:

### Frontend Tests
- **Unit Tests** with Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests** for login/register, book CRUD
- **Error handling tests** for form validations and failed submissions
- **Coverage Report**: Achieves over 90% test coverage for main pages

### Backend Tests
- **Unit & Integration Tests** using Jest + Supertest
- Tested endpoints:
  - `/api/auth/register`
  - `/api/auth/login`
  - `/api/books`
  - `/api/borrow/:id`
- Edge cases, security headers, and error handling validated

### Tools Used
- Jest
- Vitest
- Postman
- ESLint & Prettier
- Coverage reporting via V8 and Istanbul
